# Flask-web-server
Flask web server with Python



I have written a simple app in Python to communicate with Flask and build a web server. 
For that I used a raspberry pi 3 and also an 8-channel relay. By using a simple HTML file and bootstrap 
you can control each channel of the relay with a button. I used raspbian and Thonny IDE for python and 
Sublime text for the HTML file.
