# Flask-web-server
Flask web server with Python



I have made a simple app in Python to communicate with Flask and build a web server. 
For that I used a raspberry pi 3 and also an 8-channel relay. By using a simple HTML file and bootstrap 
you can control each channel of the relay with a button. I used raspbian and Thonny IDE for python and 
Sublime text for the HTML file.


I used:

- Python3               (https://www.python.org/)
- Flask                 (http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- Raspberry Pi 3(2016)  (https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
- 8-Channel relay(5V)   (http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=8_Channel_5V_Relay_Module)
